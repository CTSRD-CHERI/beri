This directory contains some scripts for manipulating trace files
produced by the cheri and cheri2 simulators. They are very basic,
undocumented and rely on the ill-defined output of the bluespec code,
but they might be useful. 

The *_justpc.pl scripts are perl scripts for extracting just the
address of every commited instruction from a trace. This can be useful
for producing diffs of traces between cheri and cheri2. They are
simple perl scripts which take input from stdin and output to stdout
so can be run like this: 
./cheri2_justpc.pl < my.trace > my.justpc

trace_names.py is a python script for annotating a cheri2 trace with
symbol names corresponding to the executed instructions. It takes as
input the trace file and the output of nm when run on the ELF flie. It
is run like so:

nm my.elf > my.nm
./trace_names.py -t my.trace -N my.nm

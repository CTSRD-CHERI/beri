Release notes for CHERI Arcina release
December 19, 2014

Software changes:
 - Updated CheriBSD to support the latest ISAv3 as documented in "Capability
   Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture"
   Version 1.11.
 - Added cheri_tcpdump, the January 2014 PI meeting demo and and a
   simple configuration tool cheri_tcpdump_control.
 - Support the MIPS UserLocal register to store TLS (Thread Local
   Storage) information.  This signficantly speeds up malloc-heavy
   workloads.
 - Added support for the FreeBSD loader.  The jtagloader may now be
   installed in flash in place of the kernel and the FreeBSD loader and
   kernel loaded from SD Card easing kenrel development.
 - Corrected support for static binaries.
 - Merged changes to upstream FreeBSD as of April 30th, 2014.  Fixes
   security issues including Heartbleed TLS bug.
 - NetFPGA10g network driver added.
 - The default configuration now restricts sshd to generating RSA, ECDSA, and
   ED25519 host keys to speed up initial boot.  Some very old ssh
   clients may be unable to connect.

Hardware changes:
 - Updated CHERI CPI to support the latest ISA as documented in "Capability
   Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Instruction-Set Architecture"
   Version 1.11.  This includes:
    - GetPCC now returns PC as the offset field of EPCC.  EPC and EPCC
      behaviors are better specified.
    - Added offsets to capabilities and the CSetOffset and CIncOffset
      instructions.
    - Added CFromPtr and CToPtr allowing capabilities to be converted to
      and from pointers preserving semantics for NULL.
    - A CPtrCmp instruction provides C-friendly comparsion of pointers.
    - The capability permissions mask was extended to add user-defined
      permissions.
    - A software-defined capability-cause register range has been made
      available, with a new CSetCause instruction letting software set the
      cause for testing or control-flow reasons.
    - New CCheckPerm and CCheckType instructions have been added, letting
      software object methods explicitly test for permissions and the
      types of arguments.
    - TLB permission bits have been added to authorize use of loading and
      storing tagged values from pages.
    - New CGetDefault and CSetDefault pseudo-ops have become the
      preferred way to control MIPS ISA memory access.
    - CCall/CReturn calling conventions were clarified; CCall now pushes
      the incremented version of the program counter, as well as stack
      pointer, to the trusted stack.
 - Significant improvements in the quality of the FPU.
 - Implemented support for the UserLocal register.
 - A new PixelStream device allows HDMI out put at configurable resolutions.

This directory hierarchy is intended for use with
the browser program to demonstrate the use of
capabilities in the form of Capsicum and CHERI to
protect an application from a library with a
developer installed backdoor.

The directories "bad" and "good" contain the same
PNG images.  The bad directory contains an extra
file which triggers the backdoor when the browser
examines the file to determine which icon to
display.  If the protection mode is set to None
it will successfully execute its payload.  If the
protection mode is set to Capsicum the protected
child process will crash, but the payload will
not be executed and a toxic warning icon will be
displayed.

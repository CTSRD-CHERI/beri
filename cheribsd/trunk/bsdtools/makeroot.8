.Nd Tool to create root filesystem images given a tree containing a manifest
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D Ar bitmask
.Op Fl B Ar byte-order
.Op Fl e Ar extras-manifest
.Op Fl f Ar filelist
.Op Fl k Ar keydir Op Fl K Ar user
.Op Fl p Ar master.passwd Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Op Fl X Ar exclude-pattern
.Ar image-file
.Ar rootdir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script creates a UFS filesystem image into
.Ar imagefile .
By default,
all filesystem objects listed in the
METALOG file contained in the
.Pa Ar rootdir
directory will be placed in the root of the UFS image
.Ar image-file .
will be placed in the root of the UFS image
.Ar image-file .
.Pp
Images can be customized with a number of different flags.
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fl B Ar byte-order
Set the byte order of the image to
.Ar byte-order .
This argument is passed directly to
.Xr makefs 8 .
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output.
.It Fl D Ar bitmask
Pass a debugging bitmask to
.Xr makefs 8 .
Debugging flags are not documented in the makefs man page but are
listed in usr.sbin/makefs/makefs.h in the FreeBSD source tree.
.It Fl e Ar manifest
Extra files listed in the
.Xr nmtree 8
format
.Ar manifest
file are added to the filesystem image.
If no contents= tag is specified or a contents= tag is relative then
files are found relative to the basename of the full path of the
manifest.
If a contents= tag is provided and it is an absolute path then the file
will be from that path.
.It Fl f Ar filelist
Constrain set of filesystem objects included from
.Ar rootdir
to those listed (one per line) in the
.Ar filelist
plus any required directories.
.It Fl k Ar keydir Op Fl K Ar user
Create a .ssh/authorized_keys file from a collection of public key files
stored in
.Ar keydir
and install it in the home directory of
.Ar user .
If no
.F K
argument is supplied then the files will be installed in the root user's
directory.
.It Fl p Ar master.passwd Op Fl g Ar group
Install an alternate
.Ar master.passwd
file and optionally an alternative
.Ar group
file.
.It Fl s Ar size
Set the size of the image to
.Ar size .
The
.Fl s
argument is passed directly to
.Xr makefs 8 .
.It Fl X Ar exclude-pattern
Exclude METALOG entries matching the extended regular express
.Ar exclude-pattern
from the image.
The
.Ar exclude-pattern
argument is passed to
.Xr grep
with the
.Fl E
and
.Fl V
flags.

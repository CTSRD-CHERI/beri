# Test jump register instructions with optional link. Test some
# different (small) offsets. The test is centered around the
# instruction labelled 'branch', which targets the one labelled
# 'target' (except for some small offsets). Padding is added before
# or after the branch to acheive the correct spacing. s0-s4 are used
# to keep track of the path taken.

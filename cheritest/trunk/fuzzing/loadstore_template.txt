# Template for two instruction fuzz test which performs a load
# followed by a store.  The types of loads and offsets are varied by
# the script. There are actually two types of test: if samesame is
# true the load and store are to the same longword with an xor to
# modify the value, otherwise the store is to the next longword with
# no xor.

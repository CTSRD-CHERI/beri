#
# Test to check that PCC/EPCC swapping on exception entry/return is correct.
# We use a non-exception trap instruction to drive the test, since we don't
# want to depend on capability exceptions working (yet).
#
# To this end, run a portion of this test with an alternative PCC able only
# to address a limited portion of address space between 'sandbox_begin' and
# 'sandbox_end'.  The linker uses global addresses, so that piece of code is
# (moderately) carefully hand-crafted to avoid global references.  We trap
# once to get in, and once to get out.
#
# Outputs to check:
#
# $a0 - exception counter (should be 2)
# $a1 - set to 1 before first trap (should be 1)
# $a2 - set to 1 after first trap (should be 1)
# $a3 - queried $ra within sandbox (should be 0x10)
# $a4 - set to 1 after second trap (should be 1)
# $a5 - linker-provided return address following sandbox restore (no check)
# $a6 - queried $ra after sandbox (should be equal to a5)
#
# $a7 - saved base of sandbox
# $s0 - saved length of sandbox (should be roughly 24)
#
# $s1 - cause register from last trap (should be TRAP)
# $s2 - EPC register from last trap (should be 0x10)
#
# $c2 - saved EPCC from first trap (before sandbox)
#     - perms from EPCC on first trap (should be 0x7fff)
#     - type from EPCC on first trap (should be 0x0)
#     - base from EPCC on first trap (should be 0x0)
#     - length from EPCC on first trap (should be 0xffffffffffffffff)
#
# $c3 - saved EPCC from second trap (in sandbox)
#     - perms from EPCC on second trap (should be 0x0001)
#     - type from EPCC on second trap (should be 0)
#     - base from EPCC on second trap (should be equal to $a7)
#     - length from EPCC on second trap (should be equal to $s0)
